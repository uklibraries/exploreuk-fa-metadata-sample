    <head>Biographical note</head>
<p>James Garnett, a Kentucky politician and judge, was born in Columbia, Kentucky, in 1871. He attended Columbia and Georgetown Colleges in Kentucky and received a degree in law from the University of Louisville in 1893. He served as county attorney in Adair County from 1897 to 1907 and as Kentucky's attorney general from 1911 to 1915. During his tenure as attorney general, he became involved in a controversy over railroad taxes. Justus Goebel, brother of the assassinated Governor William Goebel, accused Garnett of collusion with the railroads for trying to settle a suit for back taxes out of court. After his term of office, Garnett became a judge in the Chancery branch of the Jefferson County Circuit Court.</p>  </bioghist>
