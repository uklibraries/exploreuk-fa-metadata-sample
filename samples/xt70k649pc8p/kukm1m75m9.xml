Ford, a native of Daviess county, Kentucky, attended the University of Kentucky and the Maryland School of Insurance. After returning from service in the Army during World War II, he joined his family's insurance firm in Owensboro, Ky. He served as chief administrative assistant to Governor Bert T. Combs, and was elected as Democratic state senator in 1965. In 1967, he was elected lieutenant governor to serve with Republican governor Louie B. Nunn. In 1971, he was elected governor, and three years later he successfully challenged the Republican incumbent to win election to the United States Senate. He was re-elected in 1980.</p></bioghist><scopecontent><p>This is a collection of speeches made by Wendell Ford while he served as governor of Kentucky from 1971 to 1975. The speeches are divided into two categories. One set consists of addresses, remarks, and statements. These are official speeches made in Ford's capacity as governor. They include messages to the 1972 and 1974 sessions of Kentucky's General Assembly, statements on such national events as the resignations of Spiro Agnew and Richard Nixon, and remarks on such occasions as the annual Christmas tree lighting in Frankfort and the Fulton, Ky. Banana Festival. The second set is comprised of political and campaign speeches, most of them dating from 1974, during Ford's Senatorial campaign.</p></scopecontent><arrangement><p>Chronological arrangement.</p></arrangement><controlaccess><subject>Ford, Wendell H, 1924-</subject><subject>Agnew, Spiro T, 1918-</subject><subject>Cook, Marlow W.
